Hykerr is a hitchhiking app design to improve safety of HitchHikers. When 
the HitchHiker gets picked up by a oncomming car, the hiker records the 
information of the car such as License Plate, and the State of the 
license. After submitting this information, the app starts to track the 
user's location until the User decides to end the trip. It will also show 
users' past trip information such as distance and Starting and Ending 
point with it being displayed on map.
